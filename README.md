# EDA with Python, Julia and SQL

This is a project to check for my satisfaction about doing EDA with Python, Julia and SQL. Is it a good idea? Unlikely. But its a nice exercise to work out my Julia and SQL skills.

I am following along [this](https://miykael.github.io/blog/2022/advanced_eda/) awesome EDA guide by [Michael P. Notter](https://miykael.github.io/). In my humble opinion its an absolute gold standard guide for doing EDA on any (tabular) dataset. I have also decided to Jupyter notebook for the Python, Pluto.jl for Julia and DeepNote for SQL mostly cause I like working with all of these and I said to myself, why not?

P.S. Ofcourse we can't plot with SQL(AFAIK) so I am using Python for that.
